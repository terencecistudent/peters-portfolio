# Peter Lynch Photography

## Description

This is a photo gallery website that displays photographs taken by a friend of mines. The images are displayed in rows of 4 with continuous columns. Users are able to hover over and click on an image to bring up a larger version of the image. Users can scroll through the images by pressing either the right and left arrows, or by clicking on the arrows on each side of the image. The photographer's social media profiles are connected to icons at the top of the page.

## Wireframes

I have used Figma to create the wireframes: [Click here](https://github.com/terencecistudent/peters-portfolio/blob/master/wireframes/peterlynchphotography.pdf)

## Framework

For the styling side of the website, I have decided to use Bootstrap 4. As Bootstrap is a mobile first framework, this is suitable for this website as users do not need to be on a laptop or computer to see the website properly. Users can view the website using their mobiles and still access the images.

I have used the Flask framework to help loop through the images folder. I felt that if the client wanted to expand upon his website, then Flask would be suitable due to the jinja templates and routing.

## Requirements

- Access to a desktop, laptop, tablet and mobile devices.
- Internet connection.

## Features

- **Images**: Users can click and scroll through the images.
- **Social Media Icons**: Users can click on any of the social media icons which directs them to a social media profile page.

## Deployment

### Custom Domain Name:

Although I have deployed this website using Heroku, I have implemented a custom domain name which I purchased from [GoDaddy](https://uk.godaddy.com).

I watched this video from Dennis Ivy to help with the DNS settings to connect the domain name from GoDaddy to Heroku: [Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxrzD73r6Rw&t=569s).

This application was deployed using Heroku which can be viewed from here: [Peter Lynch Photography](https://www.peterlynch-photography.com)

I have used VS Code to help develop this website. This was pushed to Heroku through the command line by linking the master git from my remote GitHub repository to a new app created in Heroku.

There are no differences between the website's development version and the deployed version to Heroku.

### Deploying to Heroku:

1. Go to the Heroku website [here](https://id.heroku.com/login).

2. Sign Up or Sign In which will direct you to the dashboard.

3. Click on **New > Create new app**.

4. Enter app name and choose region then press **Create App**.

5. In the CLI, login into Heroku by **heroku login -i**, where you will be asked to your enter email address and password.

6. If you have already created your Heroku app, you can remote to your local repository with the heroku git:remote command.

7. Set debug=False for deployment.

8. To deploy your app to Heroku, use the git push command to push the code from your local repositoryâ€™s master branch to
   your heroku remote:

9. When the build is complete, on the Heroku website, in the app click **Open App**.

## Testing

### Manual Tests:

I have carried out manual tests on User Stories No. 1-4.

### Responsiveness On Different Devices Tests:

I have done tests of the website's responsiveness using both Google Chrome's and Microsoft Edge's Dev Tools.
